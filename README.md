# **Stephen Harrold Personal Portfolio / CV Website**

As part of my Code Institute course studies, I am creating this personal portfolio / CV website for my first milestone project. The website showcases my skills and experience to a potential recruiter with the aim of convincing them that I would be a valuable addition to their company. The website is built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
 
## **UX**

<!-- # STRATEGY -->

### **Overall Project Goals (Strategy Plane)**

* Convey my passion for programming

**Site Viewer Goals**
<!-- personality -->
As a recruiter,

In order to asses the profile/personality/character of the developer I want to...
* Get a comprehensive overview of the experience and skillset of this developer

<!-- technical -->
In order to assess the technical skills of the developer I want...
* The project porfolio is to be easily accessible
* The project porfolio is to be easily understandable
* The experience of navigating through the site is to be enjoyable and smooth
* The layout of the site to be intuitive
* The site to perform well on any device

<!-- action -->
In order to offer an interview to the developer I want...

<!-- potentially add section for collaborator -->

# SCOPE

### **Design Choices (Structure Plane)**
<!-- IDEA: Research on whats out there -->
<!-- about me section is to give a history which illustrates how I am a career changer -->
<!-- will it be hard to rotate a timeline in the about me section-->

<!-- Website Overall Design Structure -->
The site is designed to be a one page scrolling site. This is to make the site navigation as smooth as possible for the recruiter. My intention is that the site flows in one direction (ie. from top to bottom) with the final destination being a contact page. This replicates how a recruiter normally reads through a CV (i.e. top to bottom) which will give them a feeling of familarity.  

The viewer should not need to press any button in order to view any data, they should primarily be using their scroll wheel. The only time they should need to click their mouse is either if they want to go back and reevaluate a previously seen page (possible through the nav bar) or for them to skip content to go to a page of particular interest (e.g. on the 'about' page there is an option to jump to projects).

The page structure of the site will contain the key elements of a resume/cv: a personal pitch/summary, education, work history, skills, projects. The page structure of the site is as follows:

1. Landing Page
2. About
3. Skills
4. Project
5. Contact

The initial landing page is to include a short summary of my profile in order to give the viewer an overview of my personailty and interests. After this, the first 'About' page of the site will focus on the non technical aspects of my profile so that the viewer is not initally overwhelmed by detailed content. As the recruiter moves further through the site, the more technical information will be presented in the form of a skills page and a projects page.

* combined story about me section - to give background to my decision to switch

### **Wireframes (Skeleton Plane)**

<!-- Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser. -->

## Features
<!-- 
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. -->
 
### Existing Features
<!-- - Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future: -->

### Features Left to Implement
<!-- - Another feature idea -->

## Technologies Used

<!-- In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation. -->


## Testing

<!-- In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->

## Deployment

<!-- This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally. -->
